# About-me
## Hey!
### I am a young data analyst interested in Statistics, Predictive Analytics and Data Visualization practices. I have pursued my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Applied Statistics and Economics after which I have been working in the analytics and BI domain for over 2 years. 

### I am thoroughly captivated by the power that statistics has in helping solve business problems with unprecedented accuracy! I look forward to developing my acumen further in data science by deep-diving into my mathematical, statistical and story-telling abilities.

### Currently, I am working in the carbon emissions market helping rural households across Africa and India have efficient access to clean cooking equipment by leveraging the data on carbon emission rates. Being a newbie in this sector, I am educating myself each day about the new tide that data and AI have brought over climate change. 

### My GitHub profile has projects that I have built to develop myself as a data analyst/scientist and this platform will continue to host projects with the same intention. I also write articles on data occasionally on https://medium.com/divekartanvi999. You can check my LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvi-divekar/.
